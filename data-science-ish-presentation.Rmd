# Background/Motivation

---

Mixed effects (or multilevel) models are extensions of linear models (regressions) that are commonly used in experimental research and policy and evaluation contexts, but are less widely-used by data scientists.

# Building up to Mixed Effects Models
---
In this talk, I aim to introduce mixed effects model as a data science-ish statistical method that can be useful and is easy to estimate and interpret.
Regression with no pooling
Regression with complete pooling
Regression with partial pooling: mixed effects model

# Examples
---
I focus on two examples using the lme4 package in R: one each that is focused on:
traditional research (modeling hierarchically nested data
student engagement in science
commercial (estimating the best product when products have different numbers of reviews) uses
What is the best pair of boots? R.E.I.

# Connection to Bayesian Methods

Finally, I discuss the close connection between mixed effects models and Bayesian methods.
